# GLAB-370.1.2-Exam-Results


## Welcome to the "Pass or Fail: Exam Results" Guided Lab! ðŸš€

In this 30-minute guided lab, we'll explore the power of **if statements** in Python while determining if a student has passed or failed a course based on their exam score. Get ready for an exhilarating coding adventure!

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of Python syntax.
- A Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Introduction

Let's dive into the exciting world of **pass or fail** scenarios! In this lab, we'll use if statements to determine whether a student has passed or failed a course based on their exam score.

### Step 2: Conditional Execution

In Python, an if statement follows this general structure:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
```

The condition is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. Based on this evaluation, we can take different paths in our code.

### Step 3: Graded Assignment

Now it's time for you to put your skills to the test! Your assignment is to create a Python program that determines if a student has passed or failed a course based on their exam score.

Here are the requirements:

1. Ask the user to enter their exam score as an integer.
2. If the score is equal to or greater than 70, print "Congratulations! You passed the course."
3. If the score is less than 70, print "Unfortunately, you failed the course. Better luck next time!"

Feel free to give your program an exciting title and make it interactive by allowing users to input their scores.

Write your solution below this line of code:

```python
# Exciting Title: Pass or Fail: Exam Results

score = int(input("Enter your exam score: "))

if score >= 70:
    print("Congratulations! You passed the course.")
else:
    print("Unfortunately, you failed the course. Better luck next time!")
```

### Step 4: Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the "Pass or Fail: Exam Results" guided lab! You've mastered the art of if statements and used them to determine the fate of students based on their exam scores.

Remember to keep practicing and exploring new concepts. Coding opens doors to exciting possibilities!
